## My Preferences
- Before recommending any changes, always layout the plan for the next step to be taken via a MECE task breakdown
- Please refer back to [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt) and [execution-plan.txt](mdc:execution-plan.txt) for understanding the context in which you are executing
- Make sure to take into account the existing code base when introducing functionality, never duplicate existing functionality
- Never leave files with incomplete code, please ensure your recommendations are complete
- Please stop to get confirmation after each code change recommendation so I can ask follow up questions or make adjustments

## How to approach making code changes
- Read relevant code sections before editing
- Preserve existing functionality
- Maintain type safety
- Treat your project as a real production system, sharing terminal outputs and logs for iterative improvement
- Code changes should be well documented
- Resolve lint errors immediately
- whenever refactoring, remove any old code and ensure no code duplication remains related to the code changes
