# Invoice Processing System - Execution Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for building an AI-powered invoice processing system using Next.js, SQLite, and AI agents. The system will allow company admins to upload vendor invoices and automatically extract, validate, and manage invoice information.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Database Design (1-2 hours)
1. Review and understand the starter codebase
2. Set up database schema for:
   - Invoices table (id, customer_name, vendor_name, invoice_number, invoice_date, due_date, amount, created_at, updated_at)
   - Line items table (id, invoice_id, description, quantity, unit_price, total)
   - Token usage tracking table (id, invoice_id, input_tokens, output_tokens, cost)
3. Implement database migrations
4. Set up environment variables for API keys

## Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (2-3 hours)
1. Implement file upload functionality
   - Set up file upload component with drag-and-drop support
   - Ensure file upload can happen anywhere on the web page
   - Have an indicator that file upload is possible by dragging a file into the window
   - Add file type validation (PDF, images)
   - Implement file size limits and error handling
   - Only allow for uploading 1 invoice at a time
      - throw an error when a second file is uploaded
      - allow deleting the current uploaded file
2. Enhance existing chat interface
   - Extend current Shadcn chat UI for invoice context
   - Leverage existing message history system
   - Integrate file upload with chat flow
3. Extend AI agent framework
   - Use existing Vercel AI SDK configuration
   - Adapt current prompt templates for invoice processing
   - Utilize established Claude integration

## Phase 3: Invoice Processing Logic (2-3 hours)
1. Implement invoice validation
   - Create validation rules for invoice documents
   - Add checks to prevent non-invoice uploads
   - Implement duplicate detection logic
2. Develop AI extraction pipeline
   - Create prompts for extracting key information
   - Implement structured data parsing
   - Add validation for extracted data
3. Build database operations
   - Implement CRUD operations for invoices
   - Add line items management
   - Set up duplicate checking logic

## Phase 4: Invoice Management Interface (3-4 hours)
1. Set up navigation and routing
   - Create "Invoices" page route
   - Add navigation menu component
   - Implement navigation between chat and invoices pages
   - Add breadcrumb navigation
2. Create invoice table component
   - Implement sorting functionality
   - Add filtering capabilities
   - Create inline editing interface
   - Add pagination controls
   - Implement search functionality
3. Build invoice details view
   - Add detailed invoice information display
   - Implement line items table
   - Create edit/update functionality
   - Add "Back to Invoices" navigation
## Phase 4.5: Analytics Dashboard (2-3 hours)
1. Create Analytics page route
   - Add "Analytics" to navigation menu
   - Implement /analytics route
   - Add breadcrumb navigation
   - Create analytics page layout

2. Build token usage chart
   - Implement interactive line chart showing average daily token usage
   - Add toggles for input vs output tokens
   - Include cost trend overlay
   - Add date range selector
   - Implement hover tooltips with detailed metrics

3. Create usage details table
   - Build sortable table with columns:
     - Date/Time
     - Invoice Number (linked to invoice details)
     - Input Tokens
     - Output Tokens
     - Total Cost
     - Model Used
   - Add pagination controls
   - Implement reverse chronological sorting
   - Add CSV export functionality

4. Add summary statistics
   - Display total tokens used (MTD/YTD)
   - Show average cost per invoice
   - Calculate cost projections
   - Highlight usage anomalies

## Phase 5: AI Agent Enhancement (2-3 hours)
1. Implement prompt caching
   - Set up caching mechanism
   - Add token usage optimization
   - Create cache statistics tracking
2. Enhance duplicate detection
   - Implement fuzzy matching
   - Add confidence scoring
   - Create user-friendly duplicate alerts
3. Add advanced validation
   - Implement business rule validation
   - Add data consistency checks
   - Create validation feedback system

## Phase 6: Testing and Polish (1-2 hours)
1. Comprehensive testing
   - Test file upload with various formats
   - Validate AI extraction accuracy
   - Test duplicate detection
2. Performance optimization
   - Optimize database queries
   - Improve response times
   - Enhance UI responsiveness
3. Final polish
   - Add loading states
   - Implement error handling
   - Add success notifications

## Technical Stack Details
- Frontend: Next.js, Shadcn, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes
- Database: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
- AI: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, OpenAI GPT-4
- File Processing: PDF.js for PDF parsing
- UI Components: Shadcn components
- State Management: React hooks
- API Integration: Vercel AI SDK

## Estimated Timeline
- Total estimated time: 10-13 hours
- Recommended buffer: 2-3 hours for unexpected issues
- Total project timeline: 2-3 days

## Success Criteria
1. Successful invoice upload and processing
2. Accurate AI extraction of key information
3. Effective duplicate detection
4. Smooth user experience with the chat interface
5. Functional invoice management table
6. Accurate token usage tracking
7. Efficient prompt caching system

## Notes
- Focus on core functionality first
- Implement bonus features if time permits
- Prioritize user experience and error handling
- Document API usage and costs
- Test thoroughly with sample invoices
